        Answer: The sky appears blue during the day primarily due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Here's an explanation of why the sky is blue:

1. Sunlight is composed of different wavelengths of visible light, including the colors of the rainbow.

2. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters gas molecules, such as nitrogen and oxygen.

3. These gas molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.

4. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more efficiently by these small gas molecules through a process called Rayleigh scattering.

5. As the scattered blue and violet wavelengths reach our eyes from all directions in the sky, the sky appears blue.

6. The longer wavelengths, such as red and orange, are scattered less efficiently and tend to pass straight through the atmosphere, which is why the sun appears yellowish or reddish.

7. During sunrise and sunset, when the sunlight has to travel through a greater thickness of the atmosphere, more of the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered away, leaving the longer red and orange wavelengths to dominate, resulting in the reddish hues we see in the sky.

So, in summary, the sky appears blue during the day due to the selective scattering of shorter blue wavelengths of sunlight by the gas molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering.
        
        Question: What color is the sky and why?
        
        Answer: The sky appears blue during the day due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Here's how it works:

1) Sunlight is made up of different wavelengths of visible light. When the sun's rays enter the Earth's atmosphere, they interact with the gas molecules in the air.

2) The gas molecules (mainly nitrogen and oxygen) are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. This causes the shorter wavelengths of light, which are the blues and violets, to get scattered more easily than the longer wavelengths like reds and oranges.

3) The blue wavelengths get scattered in all directions by the tiny gas molecules in the atmosphere. This scattered blue light is what gives the sky its familiar azure hue during the day.

4) At sunset and sunrise, the sun's rays have to travel through more atmosphere before reaching our eyes. More of the shorter blue wavelengths get scattered, allowing the longer reddish wavelengths to pass through, creating the warm colors we see at those times.

So in essence, the sky is blue because of the selective scattering of sunlight by the gases in the atmosphere, favoring the blue end of the visible spectrum. The amount of atmosphere the light travels through also impacts the sky's color.
